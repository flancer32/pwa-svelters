/**
 * Global type definitions for the project using JSDoc.
 *
 * This file provides type definitions for commonly used libraries
 * and makes them available across the entire project. It eliminates
 * the need to redefine or import these types in every module.
 *
 * To use these definitions in your code:
 * - Ensure your IDE (e.g., PhpStorm) is configured to recognize this file as a library.
 * - For PhpStorm, add this file in `Settings > Languages & Frameworks > JavaScript > Libraries`.
 * - The `./node_modules/ director should be indexed (not canceled).
 *
 * Libraries and types included here:
 * - Knex: Provides types for database query building (`Knex.QueryBuilder`, etc.).
 *
 * Add additional type definitions below as needed.
 *
 * @typedef { import('knex') } Knex
