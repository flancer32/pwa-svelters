    <div class="head">Hi there!</div>

    <div class="txt">
        I'm Alex, the creator of <a class="brand" href="https://nutrilog.app.wiredgeese.com">NutriLog</a>.
    </div>

    <div class="txt">
        Back in the fall of 2024, I weighed almost 220 pounds at 5'9". I decided to lose weight using a low-calorie diet
        — and tracked everything with the help of a GPT chat. It worked.
    </div>

    <div class="txt">
        As a web developer, I built a tool that connects a customized GPT assistant with a web app to automate the
        routine and make daily tracking less of a chore.
    </div>

    <div class="txt">
        That’s how <a class="brand" href="https://nutrilog.app.wiredgeese.com">NutriLog</a> was born — and now it’s open
        for others to try.
    </div>

    <div class="txt">
        <strong>What it’s all about</strong><br/>
        <a class="brand" href="https://nutrilog.app.wiredgeese.com">NutriLog</a> is for people who use GPT chats to help
        manage their nutrition: some are losing weight, some maintaining, some gaining.
    </div>

    <div class="txt">
        The goal isn’t just weight management — it’s collaboration. If you're exploring how AI can support your journey
        — and want tools like progress tracking, profile storage, and visual analytics — <a class="brand"
                                                                                            href="https://nutrilog.app.wiredgeese.com">NutriLog</a>
        is for you.
    </div>

    <div class="txt">
        I’m sharing my experience. In fact, this project is that experience, made public. And if you have questions —
        you can ask directly through the GPT assistant. It knows how to reach me.
    </div>

    <div class="txt">
        <strong>Important:</strong> To use <a class="brand" href="https://nutrilog.app.wiredgeese.com">NutriLog</a>
        fully, you’ll need an active ChatGPT Plus subscription from OpenAI.

        <strong>What’s new</strong><br/>
        This email is my first attempt at showing how I use GPT inside <a class="brand"
                                                                          href="https://nutrilog.app.wiredgeese.com">NutriLog</a>.
        I made a short intro page — no video yet, just text and screenshots:

        </a>
    </div>

    <div class="txt">
        I’d love to know if this kind of format works for you.
    </div>

    <div class="txt">
        <strong>How to send feedback</strong><br/>
        Once you authorize your GPT assistant to use <a class="brand" href="https://nutrilog.app.wiredgeese.com">NutriLog</a>
        tools, just say:<br/>
        “I want to send something to the project author.”<br/>
        You can write in any language — GPT will translate and email it to me. I read every message.

        Thanks for reading this far.<br/>
        <a class="brand" href="https://nutrilog.app.wiredgeese.com">NutriLog</a> is, first and foremost, an experiment —

        The real goal is to explore how people and AI can work together in meaningful, practical ways.
