    <div class="email-heading">Hi there!</div>
    <div class="email-text">
        I'm Alex, the creator of NutriLog.
        <br/><br/>
        Back in the fall of 2024, I weighed almost 220 pounds at 5'9". I decided to lose weight using a low-calorie diet
        — and tracked everything with the help of a GPT chat. It worked.
        <br/><br/>
        As a web developer, I built a tool that connects a customized GPT assistant with a web app to automate the
        routine and make daily tracking less of a chore.
        <br/><br/>
        That’s how NutriLog was born — and now it’s open for others to try.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>What it’s all about</strong><br/>
        NutriLog is for people who use GPT chats to help manage their nutrition: some are losing weight, some
        maintaining, some gaining.
        <br/><br/>
        The goal isn’t just weight management — it’s collaboration. If you're exploring how AI can support your journey
        — and want tools like progress tracking, profile storage, and visual analytics — NutriLog is for you.
        <br/><br/>
        I’m sharing my experience. In fact, this project is that experience, made public. And if you have questions —
        you can ask directly through the GPT assistant. It knows how to reach me.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Important:</strong> To use NutriLog fully, you’ll need an active ChatGPT Plus subscription from OpenAI.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>What’s new</strong><br/>
        This email is my first attempt at showing how I use GPT inside NutriLog. I made a short intro page — no video
        yet, just text and screenshots:
        <br/>
        <a class="email-link" href="https://nutrilog.app.wiredgeese.com/app/playbook/start.html">
            https://nutrilog.app.wiredgeese.com/app/playbook/start.html
        </a>
        <br/><br/>
        I’d love to know if this kind of format works for you.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>How to send feedback</strong><br/>
        Once you authorize your GPT assistant to use NutriLog tools, just say:
        <br/>
        “I want to send something to the project author.”
        <br/>
        You can write in any language — GPT will translate and email it to me. I read every message.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>One request</strong><br/>

            Thanks for reading this far.<br/>
            NutriLog is, first and foremost, an experiment — though I do hope it will eventually pay for itself.<br/>
            The real goal is to explore how people and AI can work together in meaningful, practical ways.
            <br/><br/>
            If you're curious about how far human–AI collaboration can go — you're more than welcome to join the
            journey.
            <br/><br/>
            Warm regards,<br/>
