Hi there! I'm Alex, the creator of NutriLog.

Back in the fall of 2024, I weighed almost 220 pounds at 5'9".
I decided to lose weight using a low-calorie diet — and tracked everything with the help of a GPT chat. It worked.

As a web developer, I built a tool that connects a customized GPT assistant with a web app to automate the routine and make daily tracking less of a chore.

That’s how NutriLog was born — and now it’s open for others to try.

What it’s all about

NutriLog is for people who use GPT chats to help manage their nutrition:
some are losing weight, some maintaining, some gaining.

The goal isn’t just weight management — it’s collaboration.
If you're exploring how AI can support your journey — and want tools like progress tracking, profile storage, and visual analytics — NutriLog is for you.

I’m sharing my experience. In fact, this project is that experience, made public.
And if you have questions — you can ask directly through the GPT assistant. It knows how to reach me.

Important: To use NutriLog fully, you’ll need an active ChatGPT Plus subscription from OpenAI.
Without it, the assistant won't work properly.

What’s new

I’ve been thinking for a while about how to show the way I use GPT inside NutriLog.
This email is my first attempt at telling that story.

Here’s a short intro page I put together:

No video yet — just text and screenshots.
I’d love to know if this kind of format works for you.

How to send feedback

NutriLog has a built-in feedback tool the assistant can use to contact me.

Once you authorize your GPT assistant to use NutriLog tools, you can simply say:
"I want to send something to the project author."

Write in any language — GPT will translate and email it to me.
I read every message.

One request

NutriLog is currently in beta, and spots are limited.
If you signed up by mistake or realized it’s not for you, please delete your account:
https://nutrilog.app.wiredgeese.com/app/account/delete

That frees up space for someone who really wants to be part of the experiment.

Thanks for reading this far.

NutriLog is, first and foremost, an experiment — though I do hope it will eventually pay for itself.
The real goal is to explore how people and AI can work together in meaningful, practical ways.

If you're curious about how far human–AI collaboration can go — you're more than welcome to join the journey.

Warm regards,
