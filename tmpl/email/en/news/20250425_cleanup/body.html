    <div class="head">Hi there,</div>

    <div class="txt">
        Thank you for signing up for <a class="brand" href="https://nutrilog.app.wiredgeese.com">NutriLog</a> — a tool
        that connects a GPT assistant with a web app to help you track your nutrition and collaborate with AI.
    </div>

    <div class="txt">
        NutriLog is currently in <strong>beta</strong>, with a limited number of available accounts. Our goal is to
        support 100 active users — people who are experimenting, engaging, and exploring how GPT can help manage
        nutrition.
    </div>

    <div class="txt">
        <strong>Why you're receiving this</strong><br/>
        You have an account, but we haven’t seen any activity yet.
        That means there's no saved profile or food log in the system.
    </div>

    <div class="txt">
        To keep the beta focused, we will <strong>automatically remove inactive accounts in 7 days</strong>.
    </div>

    <div class="txt">
        <strong>What you need to know</strong><br/>
        - If you registered by mistake or decided NutriLog isn’t for you — no action is needed. Your account will be
        removed automatically.<br/>
        - If you’re curious and want to try NutriLog — just start using it. Create a profile or log a meal through the
        assistant.<br/>
        - If you prefer to delete your account right away, here’s the link:<br/>
        <a class="link" href="https://nutrilog.app.wiredgeese.com/app/account/delete">

        </a>
    </div>

    <div class="txt">
        <strong>Why this matters</strong><br/>
        NutriLog is an experiment — and your participation helps shape it.<br/>
        If you’re someone who uses GPT regularly and wants to explore how it can support long-term goals like weight
        management, NutriLog was made for you.
