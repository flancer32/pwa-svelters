Hi there,

Thank you for signing up for NutriLog — a tool that connects a GPT assistant with a web app to help you track your nutrition and collaborate with AI.

NutriLog is currently in beta, with a limited number of available accounts. Our goal is to support 100 active users — people who are experimenting, engaging, and exploring how GPT can help manage nutrition.

Why you're receiving this:

You have an account, but we haven’t seen any activity yet.
That means there's no saved profile or food log in the system.

To keep the beta focused, we will automatically remove inactive accounts in 7 days.

What you need to know:

- If you registered by mistake or decided NutriLog isn’t for you — no action is needed. Your account will be removed automatically.
- If you’re curious and want to try NutriLog — just start using it. Create a profile or log a meal through the assistant.
- If you've made up your mind and prefer to delete your account now, you can do that here:
  https://nutrilog.app.wiredgeese.com/app/account/delete

Why this matters:

NutriLog is an experiment — and your participation helps shape it.

If you’re someone who uses GPT regularly and wants to explore how it can support long-term goals like weight management, NutriLog was made for you.

Thanks again for being part of this journey.

Warm regards,
Alex Gusev
