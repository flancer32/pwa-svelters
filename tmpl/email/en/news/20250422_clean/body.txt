Dear NutriLog user,

NutriLog is currently in open beta, and we're looking for active users to help us improve the app.

We understand the project may feel unclear at first — that’s why we’ve prepared a short introduction to help you get started:
https://nutrilog.app.wiredgeese.com/app/playbook/start.html

If you can, please try using the food diary together with the Assistant (GPT chat) sometime this week.
Your feedback and activity are incredibly valuable.

Thank you for being part of the experiment.

Best regards,
Alex Gusev
Creator of NutriLog
