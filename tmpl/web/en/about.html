        My name is Alex Gusev. I'm a web developer from Latvia with over 25 years of experience. NutriLog is a human–AI
        project — built together with an Assistant to explore how artificial intelligence can support real-life goals.
        It started from a practical need — I used GPT chat to track my weight but struggled with the lack of memory and
        context. That led me — with the help of an AI Assistant — to build a system where GPT can "remember" the user
        and their goals through external storage and a connected interface.
    </p>

    <p>
        NutriLog stores key data — weight, diet, goals — and makes it available directly within the conversation.
        Instead of forms and buttons, users interact naturally with the assistant. The system is based on the model
        <strong>Custom GPT → Actions → Tools</strong> and is implemented using <strong>TeqFW</strong> — a platform
        reflecting my development philosophy: modularity, JavaScript at all levels, flexible architecture, ease of
        maintenance, and LLM readiness.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was inspired by my friend Dmitry, who made real progress through a low-calorie diet. I realized that success
        comes not only from AI support, but also from the feeling of being part of a community — real people facing the
        same challenges. That’s why NutriLog is not just a tool, but an attempt to build infrastructure that connects
        such users.
    </p>

    <p>
        I don't position myself as a blogger or influencer. I'm a developer who built a solution for myself and is happy
        to help others. If you’re looking for a similar setup tailored to your needs, I’m open to collaboration.
