        <p>
            I‚Äôm a developer. When I quit smoking 15 years ago, I gained about 55 pounds in six months ‚Äî and never really
            lost them.
            At 5‚Äô9‚Äù, I‚Äôve often weighed close to 220 lbs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since 2020, I‚Äôve tracked my weight with mixed results. I had the data, but not the consistency.
        </p>
        <p>
            In October 2024, I tried a basic low-calorie diet. What helped me stick with it was using GPT chat ‚Äî as my
            assistant.
            It tracked what I ate, calculated my BMR and TDEE, kept a running log of my meals and macros, and even
            remembered the weight of my kitchen bowls.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a developer, I connected GPT to a small web app ‚Äî giving it memory. That turned it from a chatbot into a
            real tool.
        </p>
        <p>
            I‚Äôve lost 26 pounds in 7 months. If this approach worked for me, maybe it can help someone else too.

    <!-- How I use NutriLog -->
    <div class="nl-card">
        <h2 class="text-center">How I use NutriLog</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I speak or type my meals into GPT ‚Äî like: <em>"Cheese omelet, toast with butter, banana, coffee with
                sugar"</em>.
            </li>
            <li>The assistant calculates calories and macros, then saves it to my food log automatically.</li>
            <li>My web app keeps track of weight, calorie balance, and goals ‚Äî and gives me real-time feedback.</li>
            <li>I can ask GPT: <em>"How many calories do I have left today?"</em> or <em>"What‚Äôs my weight trend this
                week?"</em></li>
            <li>All data is stored outside GPT, so it has real memory between sessions ‚Äî not just chat history.</li>
        </ul>

                ‚Äî tuned to track your meals, weight, and calories through conversation.
            </li>
            <li>
                You interact using any OpenAI client ‚Äî voice or text, mobile or desktop.

            <li>
                Your data is saved and retrieved through a web app that handles user registration, GPT authorization
                (via OAuth2), and data storage in a shared relational database.
            </li>
            <li>
                The same app gives you a control panel to inspect, verify, and analyze what the assistant has
                remembered.
            </li>
            <li>
                Communication between the assistant and the app is done via a structured OpenAPI interface.
